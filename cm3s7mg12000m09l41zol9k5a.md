We all enjoy using social media. In today's digital world, itâ€™s nearly impossible to find someone who doesnâ€™t. Social platforms wield immense powerâ€”capable of making someone famous overnight. However, such power has its downsides. Today, Iâ€™ll share how one casual tweet (or X, as itâ€™s now called) turned my luck around and landed me multiple internship interviews when I was struggling to get any.

---

## Background

Hi, Iâ€™m **Chirag Aggarwal**, a 3rd-year B.Tech CSE student at a tier-3 university in India. Like many in my situation, I was struggling to secure an internship, despite:

* Two previous internship experiences
    
* Multiple solid projects
    
* A portfolio website
    
* A CGPA of **9.71**
    
* And much more
    

At the same time, I was practicing **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** daily. Although not always required for internships, I was targeting companies like **Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs**, where DSA knowledge is crucial.

## The Tweet

One day, I realized I had completed **400 problems on LeetCode**. Normally, this would be a moment of prideâ€”a milestone to share on LinkedIn and celebrate. But instead of feeling accomplished, I was disappointed. Despite my constant effort, I felt unrewarded. So, I vented my frustration on Twitter:

[![Tweet Screenshot](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzmnenwiv3wt9g9kwhld4.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzmnenwiv3wt9g9kwhld4.png)

When I posted it, I didnâ€™t expect much. I often tweeted random thoughts, and this felt like just another one of them. But, as you can see from the numbers above, it was anything but ordinary.

Soon, my phone started buzzing... and it didnâ€™t stop. Thousands of people joined the conversation.

## The Reactions

The responses to my tweet generally fell into three categories:

1. **Struggling comrades** who empathized and shared similar struggles.
    
2. **Critics** who blamed me for focusing on DSA instead of development.
    
3. **Supporters** who offered genuine help and advice.

### Struggling Comrades

The first category overwhelmed me. I was shocked to see so many talented individuals facing the same struggles. It felt like the entire industry was filled with people like meâ€”working hard and still not seeing results.

Hereâ€™s one response that really stood out:

### Critics

This was, unsurprisingly, the largest group. Due to the viral nature of my tweet, many people jumped to conclusions and shared similar critiques:

(Thanks, Rohan. Really appreciated that last one! ðŸ˜…)

Most critics suggested I focus on **projects** and **development** instead of just DSA. Ironically, thatâ€™s exactly what Iâ€™d been doing for a long time. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed development more than solving DSA problems, contributing to open source, and building amazing stuff.

Still, I understood their perspective. If I saw someone only doing DSA without focusing on development, I might have left a similar comment.

### Supporters

This was my favorite category. Although smaller, it was still more support than Iâ€™d ever expected. These tweets genuinely lifted my spirits:

These words reminded me that I was on the right track and just needed to keep pushing forward.

## What Happened Next?

**I got calls. Emails. Offers.**

The viral tweet brought me **visibility**â€”a crucial factor in landing interviews. I had a few rounds with different companies, but in the end, I accepted an offer that didnâ€™t even require a formal interview. After an introductory call and a basic assignment, I was handed the offer letter.

This happened thanks to one person:

[![Thank You Teja](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0hw2yrmswr4vlczauvb4.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0hw2yrmswr4vlczauvb4.png)

(Thanks a lot, Teja!)

## Conclusion

I wish I had a concrete lesson or formula to share, but this journey was a rollercoaster sparked by one lucky tweet.

If thereâ€™s one takeaway, itâ€™s this:

**Be active on social media. Build in public. Share your creations, passions, and energy with the world.**

Luck favors those who are ready to take advantage of it.
